//This function is used to create a rollup table. Generally a rollup table is different from group by on a single table. Group by gives the values to the colummn values for example.
/* There is a column date with the count of products purchased on that date. In group by if none of the products are purchased on a date that particular date is not shown at all. 
so if we want the output like Date ->0 for a particular date if none of the products were purchased on that day, then we need to create a rollup table.*/\
